# conebeam-CT-bp
This is an implementation of forward and backward projections for cone-beam ct.
The forward and backward operators can be applied to arbitrary geometry structures. And the geometry structures are defined as sourceposition, detector position, detector u direction and detector v direction for each projection angle.
